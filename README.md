# Python VLOOKUP-Like OperationðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¿

Perform a VLOOKUP-like operation in Python using the pandas library. This script merges two DataFrames, simulating the behavior of the Excel VLOOKUP function.

## PrerequisitesðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¿

Make sure you have Python and the pandas library installed. You can install pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## UsageðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¿

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beyondusy/Excel_Formula_Perform.git
cd Excel_Formula_Perform
```

2. Modify the sample data in the script according to your requirements.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python Excel_VLookup.py
```

## FunctionalityðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¿

- The script merges two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, based on the "ID" column.
- It handles missing values by filling them with a default value, which you can specify.
- The default value is set to 'N/A' by default.
